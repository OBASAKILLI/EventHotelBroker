## Technical Implementation

### Files Created:
1. `/Components/Pages/Owner/CreateEventEquipment.razor`
2. `/Components/Pages/Owner/CreateEventPackage.razor`

### Dependencies:
- `EventHotelBroker.Models` (EventEquipment, EventPackage)
- `EventHotelBroker.Services` (IEventService)
- `NavigationManager` (routing)
- `IJSRuntime` (alerts and interactions)

### CSS:
- Uses `/css/events-module.css`
- Uses `/css/color-theme.css` (Blue & Gold theme)
- Bootstrap 5 components
- Custom modern card styling

---

## User Guidelines

### For Equipment:
- Provide accurate descriptions and specifications
- Set competitive pricing based on market rates
- Keep inventory updated to avoid booking conflicts
- Use high-quality images to attract customers
- Equipment requires admin approval before going live

### For Packages:
- Bundle complementary items customers typically need together
- Offer packages at a discount compared to individual prices
- List exactly what's included to avoid confusion
- Target specific event types (weddings, corporate, etc.)
- Packages require admin approval before going live

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation:
- Provider ID is temporarily hardcoded as `"temp-provider-id"`
- In production, this should be retrieved from authentication context

### Production Requirements:
```csharp
// Replace this:
private string currentProviderId = "temp-provider-id";

// With this (example):
[CascadingParameter]
private Task<AuthenticationState>? AuthenticationStateTask { get; set; }

protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    var authState = await AuthenticationStateTask!;
    var user = authState.User;
    currentProviderId = user.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value ?? string.Empty;
}
```
